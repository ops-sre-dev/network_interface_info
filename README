This README provides guidance on setting up, building, and testing the network_interface_info plugin for Telegraf. The plugin is designed to gather information about network interfaces, including link status, IP address, and routing information, with options for IPv4 and IPv6.

Setup and Build Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed and set up on your system. This plugin requires Go 1.16 or later. You can download Go from the official Go website.

Initializing the Module
Start by initializing a new Go module for your plugin:

```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/network_interface_info
```
Repeat the command to ensure all dependencies are correctly initialized:

bash
Copy code
go mod init
Building the Plugin
Compile your plugin with the go build command. Run this in the root directory of your plugin:

bash
Copy code
go build
This command compiles the source code and generates an executable file named after your plugin's directory.

Installation and Testing
Placing Plugin in Telegraf
Clone the Telegraf repository from InfluxData's GitHub.

Navigate to the Telegraf plugins directory:

bash
Copy code
cd telegraf/plugins/inputs
Create a directory for your plugin:

bash
Copy code
mkdir network_interface_info
cd network_interface_info
Place your plugin files (network_interface_info.go, gather.go, init.go, and any other necessary files) into this directory.

Integrating Plugin with Telegraf
After placing your plugin in the correct directory, you need to register it with Telegraf. Ensure your init.go file contains the appropriate inputs.Add function call to register the plugin.

Rebuild Telegraf to include your plugin:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/telegraf
make
This command compiles Telegraf along with your new plugin.

Testing Your Plugin
Create a Telegraf configuration file for testing. You can start with Telegraf's default configuration file and add a section for your plugin:

toml
Copy code
[[inputs.network_interface_info]]
# Configuration options for your plugin
Run Telegraf with your configuration file:

bash
Copy code
telegraf --config your_config_file.toml
Replace your_config_file.toml with the path to your configuration file. Telegraf will start and include your plugin in its data collection process.

Conclusion
After completing these steps, you should be able to build, install, and test your network_interface_info plugin within the Telegraf framework. This includes compiling the Telegraf binary file and specifying your plugin and its configuration within the Telegraf configuration file. Ensure your Go environment is correctly set up and that your plugin code is compatible with the rest of the Telegraf project.
